##Definition of Drone Delivery and Planning:

 A drone delivery agent with 5 destinations is a specific type of UAV 
system that can be programmed to deliver packages to up to five different 
locations within a relatively small geographic area. This autonomous agent
is equipped with sensors, cameras, and other advanced technologies that 
allows it to navigate through the airspace, avoid obstacles.
 The drone starts in a single initial state(warehouse), which is typically 
a central location where packages are loaded onto the drone for delivery. 
From there, the drone travels to each of the five designated destinations, 
delivering packages along the way. The destinations can be pre-programmed 
into the drone's software or communicated to the drone in real-time by the 
delivery system.
